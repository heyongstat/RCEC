Robust Covariance Estimation for High-dimensional Compositional Data

We address the challenges of covariance estimation for high-dimensional compositional (lying in a simplex) which would also be leptokurtic and highly skewed. Assuming the basis covariance matrix lying in a well-recognized class of sparse covariance matrices, we adopt a proxy matrix known as centered log-ratio covariance matrix in the literature, which is approximately indistinguishable from the real basis covariance matrix as the dimensionality tends to infinity. We construct a Median-of-Means (MOM) estimator for the centered log-ratio covariance matrix and propose a thresholding procedure that is adaptive to the variability of individual entries.
